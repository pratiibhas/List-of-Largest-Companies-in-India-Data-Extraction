# List-of-Largest-Companies-in-India-Data-Extraction

Wikipedia serves as a rich repository of information on a wide range of topics. However, often the information available is too extensive and contains more details than necessary for specific applications. This project aims to address such situations by focusing on extracting only the most relevant information. In particular, we are targeting the "List of Largest Companies in India," which is conveniently provided in a table format on Wikipedia.

To extract this data, we utilize BeautifulSoup, a powerful Python library for web scraping, which allows us to parse and extract the table containing the desired information. We then pass the extracted data to pandas, a data manipulation library, to structure it in a database-like format, making it easier to work with and analyze.

Though this project may appear simple, it demonstrates a fundamental application of data extraction, which is often the first and most crucial step in any data science project. Without proper data extraction, it would be difficult to gather useful insights from websites and other sources. This project, therefore, showcases how extracting structured data from an unstructured source like Wikipedia can lead to actionable results.
